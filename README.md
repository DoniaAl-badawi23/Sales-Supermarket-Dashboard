# Sales-Supermarket-Dashboard
I developed a comprehensive project in PowerBI, creating a dashboard and table to analyze the data. This process involved several stages, including data preprocessing, data cleaning, and data visualization.  

# Sales-Supermarket-Dashboard (Interactive Dashboard Creation by using PowerBI)

## Project Objective:
Business Request:

1- Sales Performance Analysis:

- The total sales, total income, total cost of goods sold (COGS), and total quantity sold for the period (Q1 2019).
  
- Compare sales performance by branch, city, and gender.

2- Payment Method Insights:

- Analyze sales based on payment methods (cash, e-wallet, and credit card) to identify customer payment preferences.

3- Product Category Analysis:

- Examine sales and quantities sold for different product categories (e.g., food and beverages, fashion accessories, electronic accessories).
  
- Identify which product categories contribute the most to total sales and quantities.

4- Seasonal Trends:

- Review the monthly trend of total sales and income to identify any seasonal variations or peak sales periods.

5- Geographic and Demographic Insights:

- Determine how sales vary by city (Mandalay, Naypyitaw, Yangon).

## Dashboard


Final Conclusion:
The dashboards provide a comprehensive overview of the business's strong performance, highlighting its ability to meet sales and budget targets. However, there are opportunities for improvement in product category diversification, geographic reach, and customer growth.

Key Strengths:

Achieving 22M in sales, surpassing the 21M budget. A solid customer base of 18K customers with strong contributions from top-performing customers. Geographic sales clusters in high-demand regions like North America, Europe, and Asia. Exceptional performance in the Clothing category, contributing over 95% of total sales.

Key Challenges:

Over-reliance on a single product category (Clothing) poses a risk. Limited sales contributions from underperforming regions (South America and Africa) and categories (Bikes and Accessories). Room to grow the customer base beyond the existing 18K.

Future Outlook:

By focusing on diversification, customer acquisition, and regional expansion, the business can sustain growth and build resilience. Leveraging seasonal peaks and customer loyalty programs can further enhance profitability.

Sales Improvement Recommendations:
1- Focus on Product Mix:

Introduce promotions or bundle offers for underperforming categories like Bikes and Accessories to increase their contribution.

2- Customer Retention Programs:

Offer loyalty rewards or personalized offers to top customers like Jordan Turner to ensure continued engagement.

3- Geographic Targeting:

Invest in marketing campaigns in less saturated regions to expand the customer base globally.

4- Seasonal Promotions:

Leverage peak months like May, August, and October to maximize sales through discounts or limited-time offers.
