# Sales-Supermarket-Dashboard
I developed a comprehensive project in PowerBI, creating a dashboard and table to analyze the data. This process involved several stages, including data preprocessing, data cleaning, and data visualization.  

# Sales-Supermarket-Dashboard (Interactive Dashboard Creation by using PowerBI)

## Project Objective:
Business Request:

1- Sales Performance Analysis:

- The total sales, total income, total cost of goods sold (COGS), and total quantity sold for the period (Q1 2019).
  
- Compare sales performance by branch, city, and gender.

2- Payment Method Insights:

- Analyze sales based on payment methods (cash, e-wallet, and credit card) to identify customer payment preferences.

3- Product Category Analysis:

- Examine sales and quantities sold for different product categories (e.g., food and beverages, fashion accessories, electronic accessories).
  
- Identify which product categories contribute the most to total sales and quantities.

4- Seasonal Trends:

- Review the monthly trend of total sales and income to identify any seasonal variations or peak sales periods.

5- Geographic and Demographic Insights:

- Determine how sales vary by city (Mandalay, Naypyitaw, Yangon).

## Sales Improvement Recommendations:

1- Focus on Top-Performing Locations

- Prioritize marketing efforts and promotions in Yangon, which accounts for the highest sales (34.24%).

- Expand inventory in high-demand categories for this location.
  
- Offer location-specific promotions or loyalty programs to boost repeat purchases.

2- Enhance Gender-Based Engagement

- Observation: Sales from female customers ($168K) exceed male customers ($155K).
  
- Recommendation: Develop marketing campaigns targeting female customers while identifying opportunities to engage more male customers.
  
- Create promotions around products preferred by male customers (e.g., sports and travel or electronics).
  
- Use personalized advertising or targeted discounts to appeal to different gender segments.

3- Leverage Seasonal Trends

- Observation: January shows the highest sales and income.
  
- Recommendation: Develop a strategy to maintain momentum beyond January.

- Introduce post-holiday or seasonal promotions in February and March.
  
- Run campaigns to promote less-performing product categories in off-peak months.

4- Optimize Payment Method Options

- Observation: Cash is the most preferred payment method, followed by credit cards and e-wallets.
  
- Recommendation: Promote cashless payment methods to enhance convenience and improve transaction speed.

- Offer discounts or cashback for e-wallet or credit card payments.
  
- Collaborate with payment providers for exclusive deals.

5- Train Staff for Upselling and Cross-Selling

- Equip sales teams with strategies to recommend complementary products, especially in high-demand categories.

6- Invest in Data-Driven Marketing

- Use customer behavior insights from the dashboard to create targeted campaigns.
  
- For example:
  
   1- Promotions based on popular products.
  
   2- Targeting high-value customers with exclusive offers.
